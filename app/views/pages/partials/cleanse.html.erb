  <span class='home_bold_text'>You Have A Toxic Body</span><br/>
  Toxins are everywhere - they're in your water, makeup, plastic food storage and household cleaners.  Your levels may

  Cleansing rejuvenates and is the reset button on everything in your life.  This unique cleanse will guide you through.
  It is a trans-dimensional experience that is profoundly detoxifying and rejuvenating to the body.
  The healing process takes place on many levels: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual - with support of juices,
  shakes, soups, raw organic food, visualization, journaling, deep breathing, salt baths, saunas and yoga.

<h2>Program Includes:</h2>

<p class="home_page_body">
  <span class='home_bold_text'>Conference Calls</span><br/>
  On this cleanse, you will participate in five conference calls.  Your grocery list is covered on the first call making
  shopping a breeze.  I will explain the science behind alkalizing your body.  There will be nutritional calls and home
  therapy calls.  Calls are recorded and sent to you to listen to at your leisure should you not be able to be on the live
  call.
</p>

<p class="home_page_body">
  <span class='home_bold_text'>Facebook Group</span><br/>
  I have a private Facebook page for you to access.  You can go there for support, to ask questions and to exchange recipes.
  I'm there frequently answering questions so it becomes a bit of a classroom for everyone.  Lots of fun and always new
  friendships made.  A great place to go for a community of like-minded people interested in taking their health to the
  next level.
</p>

<p class="home_page_body">
  <span class='home_bold_text'>Products and Supplements</span><br/>
  I use only the highest grade products and supplements.  Your body will release old stuck toxins with ease when supported
  by the very best scientifically formulated products.  The products help to clean and build your blood.  Alkalizing and
  building your blood is the real beauty of this cleanse.  Learning to do this is the real Miracle.
</p>

<p class="home_page_body">
  <span class='home_bold_text'>My Personal Attention</span><br/>
  While on this cleanse I will help you closely monitor your progress.  For those of you that have tried alone to do a
  self-cleanse and have felt the need for more support and guidance - this program is for YOU!  I will also send attachments
  out to you prior to the cleanse with my favorite recipes, a daily protocol and a 14 day tracking system that will
  chart your journey.
